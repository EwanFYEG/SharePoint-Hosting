        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Ewan, your Glasgow Representative for this year's ECN Committee. This is my second year in the role, and one of my key goals from last year was to engage more with our Apprentices based in Forth Valley, as a former college student. Iâ€™m committed to ensuring that everyone feels welcome and that the opportunities we offer our members are widely accessible.</p>

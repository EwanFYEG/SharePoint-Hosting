    <h2>Scenario for AI Use Case Proritisation Framework</h2>
    <p>
      Green Grain Foods Ltd, is a mid-szed food manufacturing company expereincing operational inefficiencies and increased compettion in the market. They have identified a number of potental AI use cases but lack a structured way to evaluate, prioritise and sequence them for delivery.
    <h3>The Prioritization Matrix</h3>
    <p>
      Each AI initiative is assessed using the following six key criteria, with weights reflecting their strategic importance:
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Criteria</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Weighting</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Business Value/Impact</td>
          <td>
            Evaluates potential for revenue growth, cost reductions, market differentiation, and enhanced customer experience.
          </td>
          <td>25%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Strategic Alignment</td>
          <td>
            Assesses how well the initiative supports the company’s long-term vision and competitive positioning.
          </td>
          <td>20%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Technical Feasibility</td>
          <td>
            Considers implementation complexity, resource availability, and integration with existing systems.
          </td>
          <td>15%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Data Readiness & Quality</td>
          <td>
            Reviews whether the necessary data is available, clean, and ready to power the AI solution.
          </td>
          <td>15%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Cost & Risk Assessment</td>
          <td>
            Analyzes expected costs, ongoing expenditures, and potential risks, including regulatory and scalability concerns.
          </td>
          <td>15%</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Time-to-Value</td>
          <td>
            Estimates the deployment timeline and the time needed to achieve measurable benefits.
          </td>
          <td>10%</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Rationale Behind the Framework</h3>
    <p>
      This balanced framework bridges strategic vision with actionable execution:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Vision & Impact:</strong>  
        By emphasizing Business Value and Strategic Alignment, we ensure that each initiative not only drives revenue but also fits our market position.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practical Execution:</strong>  
        Technical Feasibility and Data Readiness ensure projects are grounded in our current infrastructure and data capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Risk & Reward:</strong>  
        Cost & Risk Assessment and Time-to-Value guarantee that we focus on initiatives with manageable risks while also capturing early wins.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each initiative is scored on a 1–5 scale for every criterion. Multiplying these scores by the respective weightings produces a composite score that objectively ranks our opportunities. Visual aids such as heat maps or quadrant charts further illustrate immediate “quick wins” versus more strategic, long-term bets.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dynamic framework encourages informed, transparent decision-making. It continuously evolves with market changes, new data, and internal resource shifts—ensuring we consistently align AI initiatives with both immediate needs and long-term growth.
